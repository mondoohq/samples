# REQUIRED: Azure subscription ID where resources will be deployed

# Location for resource deployment (default: eastus)
location = "eastus"

# Project and environment configuration

# Owner email for resource tagging (optional)
owner_email = "your-email@example.com"

# ==============================================================================
# LANGUAGE VERSIONS (Optional - defaults provided)
# ==============================================================================

# Hardened Configuration - CIS Compliant Versions
# hardened_python_version = "3.13"
# hardened_php_version    = "8.3"
# hardened_java_version   = "17"

# Vanilla Configuration - Deprecated Versions (for testing)
# vanilla_python_version = "3.7"

# ==============================================================================
# SECURITY CONFIGURATION (Optional - defaults provided)

# ==============================================================================
# SKU CONFIGURATION (Optional - defaults provided)
# ==============================================================================

# App Service Plan SKU - IMPORTANT: Choose based on deployment slot needs
#
# Option 1 - Cost Optimized (No Deployment Slots):
#   app_service_plan_sku = "B1"      # Basic - ~$13/month, NO deployment slots
#   enable_deployment_slots = false  # Must be false for B1
#   Total assets: 10 (6 Web Apps + 4 Function Apps, PHP excluded from Functions)
#
# Option 2 - Full Testing (With Deployment Slots): ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED
#   app_service_plan_sku = "S1"      # Standard - ~$70/month, supports deployment slots
#   enable_deployment_slots = true   # Can be true for S1
#   Total assets: 20 (6 Web Apps + 4 Function Apps + 10 Slots, PHP excluded from Functions)
#
# Default: S1 for full testing with deployment slots
app_service_plan_sku = "S1"
enable_deployment_slots = true

# ==============================================================================
# ASSET FILTERING (Optional - defaults to deploy all)
# ==============================================================================

# Configuration Types to Deploy
#
# Options:
#   ["vanilla", "hardened"]  - Deploy both (default, full testing)
#   ["vanilla"]              - Deploy only non-compliant configurations
#   ["hardened"]             - Deploy only CIS-compliant configurations
#
# Impact: Reduces total assets by 50% if only one config type selected
config_types_to_deploy = ["vanilla", "hardened"]

# Language Stacks to Deploy
#
# Options:
#   ["python", "php", "java"]  - Deploy all languages (default, comprehensive)
#   ["python"]                 - Deploy only Python assets (CIS 2.x.2)
#   ["php"]                    - Deploy only PHP assets (CIS 2.x.3, Web Apps only)
#   ["java"]                   - Deploy only Java assets (CIS 2.x.1)
#   ["python", "php"]          - Deploy subset of languages
#
# IMPORTANT: PHP is only supported by Web Apps, not Azure Functions!
# Azure Functions will automatically skip PHP and only deploy Python/Java.
#
# Impact: Total assets varies by language support
# Examples (default both configs):
#   - All 3 languages: 20 assets (with S1) or 10 assets (with B1)
#   - Python only: 8 assets (with S1) or 4 assets (with B1)
#   - Java only: 8 assets (with S1) or 4 assets (with B1)
#   - PHP only: 4 Web Apps (with S1) or 2 Web Apps (with B1), no Functions
